In this paper we presented HyperCell, a reconfigurable hardware datapath for realizing IEs that are identified post-silicon. We also presented an efficient synthesis methodology for datapath synthesis of such IEs. 
HyperCell hosts DFGs that correspond to code-segments from various applications, and are cast as IEs. 
The reconfigurability of HyperCell along with a generalized approach for synthesizing IEs enable reuse of the same hardware as datapath for diverse IEs. 
The synthesis flow generates configuration information to exploit the hardware resources of HyperCell optimally. 
The proposed mapping technique nullifies adverse effects of unbalanced dependence edges on the initiation interval of IE DFGs.  
Our proposed scheduling technique enables software pipelined execution of IEs minimizing initiation interval between successive dynamic instances.
While scheduling we maximally exploit temporal reuse of data to reduce the pressure on the input/output bandwidth requirements of the proposed reconfigurable hardware.
