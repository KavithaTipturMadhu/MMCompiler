  abstract =	"The design of an instruction set processor includes
		 several related design tasks: instruction set design,
		 microarchitecture design, and code generation. Although
		 there have been automatic approaches for each
		 individual task, the investigation of the interaction
		 between these tasks still primarily relies on
		 designers' experience and ingenuity. It is thus the
		 goal of this research to develop formal models and
		 algorithms to investigate such interaction
		 systematically. This dissertation presents a two-phase
		 co-synthesis approach to the problem. In the
		 architectural level, given a set of application
		 benchmarks and a pipeline structure, the ASIA
		 (Automatic Synthesis of Instruction set Architecture)
		 design automation system generates an instruction set
		 and allocates hardware resources which best fit the
		 applications, and, at the same time, maps the
		 applications to assembly code with the synthesized
		 instruction set. This approach formulates the codesign
