This folder contains basic block optimization pass for LLVM IR
the following optimizations are implemented:
1. Constant propogation
2. Constant folding
3. Dead code elimination
4. Redundant expression elimination
5. Common subexpression elimination

To run this, 
1. Copy the parent folder to llvm/lib/Transforms folder.
2. Build with make command in the current folder.
3. run the following command from the current folder.
	opt --load ../../../Debug+Asserts/lib/libDemoBasicBlockPass.so -demoBasicBlockPass < inputfilename

Input file : LLVM IR file in non SSA form
Output : optimized LLVM code

Sample llvm files are available in SampleLLVMFiles folder. 
Optimizer step when run prints out the optimized llvm IR also. This can be verified.
